15th, 25th, and 50th percentiles of cumulative CPUE of Yukon River Chinook salmon caught on the Yukon River Delta, Alaska from 1961â€“2020. Data are from PR Mundy and DF Evenson based on <https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsr080> and have been updated by BD Mecum since using ADF&G in-season data.

## Updates (reverse chronological)

- 2024: ADF&G chose not to operate LYTF for Chinook in 2024 so there's on data for this year.
- 2022: Percentile dates were derived from BE Set instead of Drift as planned. A comparison of BE Set against BE Drift as well as both BE sites against Pilot Station and Eagle sonars suggested BE Set more accurately indexed the run.

    | Percentile | BE Set | BE Drift | Pilot | Eagle |
    |-|-|-|-|-|
    | FIFDJ | June 6    | June 4  | June 13     | July 15    |
    | QDJ   | June 10   | June 5  | June 19     | July 18   |
    | MDJ   | June 22   | June 18 | June 29     | July 29   |
